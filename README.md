# life-Expectancy-Data-Analysis


Life expectancy refers to the number of years a person is expected to live based on the statistical average. It is a measure that summarizes the mortality of a country, allowing us to compare it by generations and analyze trends. It depends on the geographical context of the area. There is no better indicator of a country's social development than having a long and healthy life. Life expectancy expansion is a result of, among other things, improvements in nutrition, health and, above all, a decrease in mortality.
Period life expectancy (PLE) is one of the most used summary indicators for the overall health of a population. It is based on the set of observed age-specific death rates, i.e., the number of deaths in a certain year and age group divided by the average number of people alive in this year and age group.

ABSTRACT 

According to data published in 1972, people with the Marfan syndrome had significantly shorter life expectancies, and the majority of fatalities are cardiovascular in nature. This study looked at whether survival rates for people with Marfan syndrome had changed since 1972 and whether prognosis has changed as a result of medicinal or surgical treatment. 417 cases from 4 referral centres with a confirmed diagnosis of Marfan syndrome were used to create survival curves. The analysis took into account each of the following factors: date of birth, age at death, cardiovascular surgery, therapy with blockers, or any combination of these. 47 patients out of 417 passed away. When compared to age in 1972 (32 16 years), the mean age at death (41 18 years) increased significantly (p = 0.0023).

Comparatively to 48 years in 1972, the median (50%) cumulative chance of survival in 1993 was 72 years. The 10-year likelihood of survival for the 112 surgically treated individuals was 70%. Patients who had surgery after 1980 had a considerably higher chance of surviving than those who had surgery before 1980 (p = 0.008).

In conclusion, patients with Marfan syndrome now live longer than 25 percent longer than they did in 1972. This sharp rise in incidence could be attributed to a number of factors, including: (1) a general increase in population life expectancy; (2) advantages of cardiovascular surgery; and (3) a higher proportion of milder cases as a result of more frequent diagnosis. A higher likelihood of survival was also linked to medical treatment, including blockers.
